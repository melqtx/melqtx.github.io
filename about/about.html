    <p>Sup, fellow anons and tech nerds! I'm Melano, your friendly neighborhood CS freshman and wannabe ML wizard.</p>
    <p>Be me: freshman studying CSE/ML, lowkey obsessed with machines (not the gym kind, you meatheads).</p>
    <p>Currently turning my smooth brain into a galaxy brain:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><em><s>Electrons (spicy air)</s></em></li>
        <li><em><s>Electronic Circuits (spicy air parkour)</s></em></li>
        <li><em><s>Transistors (nature's light switches)</s></em></li>
        <li><em><s>Logic Gates (binary bouncers)</s></em></li>
        <li><em><s>Latches (memory for goldfish)</s></em></li>
        <li><em><s>Digital Circuits (LEGO for big boys)</s></em></li>
        <li><em><s>Comp Arch (how to build a glorified calculator)</s></em></li>
        <li>Machine Language (talking to robots in their sleep)</li>
        <li>Assembly (when you hate yourself but love efficiency)</li>
        <li>C/C++ (for when Python is too slow)</li>
        <li>DS, Algos (fancy ways to sort your anime list)</li>
        <li>OOP (teaching objects how to do your job)</li>
        <li>OS (how to make a computer schizophrenic)</li>
        <li>Python (snek that does math)</li>
        <li>Web Development (making shiny things for normies to click)</li>
        <li>Data Science (Excel on steroids)</li>
        <li>ML (teaching machines to think so I don't have to)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Following this roadmap in chronological order, because I like my brain medium-rare.</em></p>
    <p><em>last updated: 2024-05-24 (or whenever I remember this page exists)</em></p>
    <p>When not coding: reading books (yes, the ones with pages), pretending to be Ansel Adams, watching mind-bending films, and listening to music that isn't just CPU fan noise.</p>
    <p>Wanna debate P vs NP or if we're in a simulation? Hit me up! I promise I won't bite (unless you prefer Python 2).</p>
    <p>Remember, as Feynman said, "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics." Same goes for my code, but hey, we're all here to learn, right?</p>
    <p>. -. -.. (of transmission, not my learning... hopefully)</p>
