    <p>Sup, fellow anons and tech nerds! I'm Melano, your friendly neighborhood CS freshman and wannabe ML wizard. Lowkey obsessed with machines (not the gym kind, you meatheads).</p>
    <p>Currently turning my smooth brain into a galaxy brain:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning (teaching robots to think so I don't have to)</li>
        <li>Data Science (Excel on steroids)</li>
        <li>Web Development (making shiny things for normies to click)</li>
        <li>Python (snek that does math)</li>
        <li>C/C++ (for when Python is too slow)</li>
        <li>Assembly (when you hate yourself but love efficiency)</li>
        <li>DS & Algos (fancy ways to sort your anime list)</li>
        <li>OOP (teaching objects how to do your job)</li>
        <li>OS (how to make a computer schizophrenic)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When not coding: reading books, pretending to be Ansel Adams, watching mind-bending films, and listening to music that isn't just CPU fan noise.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, as Feynman said, "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics." Same goes for my code, but hey, we're all here to learn, right?</p>
    
    <p>.-. ... (of transmission, not my learning... hopefully)</p>
